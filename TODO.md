# TODO List for Game Enhancement

- [x] Adjust game physics to make it easier (reduce gravity to 0.3, increase jump strength to -6, increase pipe gap to 250, reduce pipe speed to 1.5)
- [x] Modify character drawing to add animated body with visible bum below the head
- [x] Ensure head uses default friend's face (assets/character.png) and remove user ability to change face
- [x] Remove "Change Face" buttons from menu and game over screens in GamePage.jsx
- [x] Test the game to ensure changes work and difficulty is balanced
